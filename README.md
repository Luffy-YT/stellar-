# On-chain Warranty Tracking

## Project Description

A blockchain-based warranty management system built on the Stellar network that issues tokens representing product warranties and enables transparent, immutable tracking of warranty claims and lifecycle events. This smart contract solution eliminates paper-based warranty cards, prevents fraud, and provides manufacturers and consumers with a reliable, decentralized warranty verification system.

## Project Vision

To revolutionize warranty management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and efficient ecosystem where product warranties are digitally tokenized, easily transferable, and verifiable. Our vision is to eliminate warranty fraud, reduce administrative overhead for manufacturers, and empower consumers with seamless warranty claim experiences that build trust and accountability across the product lifecycle.
